Configuration
-------------

The milter reads configuration from /etc/authentication_milter.json

The configuration file format is as follows...

{
    "connection"       : "inet:12345\@localhost",     | The connection to use 
    "runas"            : "nobody",                    | Drop privs and run as this user

    "show_default_adsp" : "0",                        | Boolean, include default adsp results?

                                                      | Checks to include.
                                                      | "0" Do not include check.
                                                      | "1" Include check.

        "example.net"
    ]

}



DMARC
-----

This milter uses Mail::DMARC as a backend for DMARC checks, this module requires that a configuration
file is setup.

You should create and populate /etc/mail-dmarc.ini

For DMARC reporting you are also required to setup a datastore, including creating a basic table
structure.  The detauls of this are to be found in the Mail::DMARC documentation, or in the
share/schema.sql file included with the source code to this milter.

At this time forensic reports are not supported by Mail::DMARC or this milter. Only aggregate reports will
be generated.

To check reports please use the dmarc_view_reports command, to send reports please use the dmarc_send_reports
command. These are included with the Mail::DMARC module.
